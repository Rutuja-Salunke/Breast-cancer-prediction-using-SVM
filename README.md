## Introduction
Breast cancer is a critical health concern, and accurate prediction is vital for timely intervention and treatment decisions. This project utilizes SVM, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to analyze features associated with breast cancer and predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

Breast Cancer Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning project designed to predict breast cancer malignancy based on relevant features. Leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from scikit-learn, this project involves data gathering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and visualization of the decision boundary.


By combining machine learning techniques with domain-specific datasets, this Breast Cancer Prediction project contributes to the ongoing efforts in leveraging technology for early and accurate detection of breast cancer, ultimately aiding healthcare professionals in providing better patient care.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The workflow begins with data gathering, where the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is loaded. Subsequent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides insights into the dataset's structure and identifies any missing values. The project then progresses to model training, where an SVM model is trained on the dataset, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics.
Explore the dataset's shape, information, and check for missing values.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Train an SVM model on the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R2 Score.

## Visualization


One notable aspect of the project is the visualization of the SVM decision boundary. The ability to visually represent how the SVM distinguishes between malignant and benign cases enhances interpretability and provides valuable insights into the model's decision-making process.
## Usage


The project's user-friendly interface allows seamless execution, making it accessible for users interested in understanding SVM's application in breast cancer prediction. Contributions are welcome, and the project is open-source, fostering collaboration and improvement.
