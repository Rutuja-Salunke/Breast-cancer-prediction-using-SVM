## Introduction

Briefly introduce your project, its purpose, and the main goals. Mention that it uses SVM for breast cancer prediction.

## Data

The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from scikit-learn. It includes features related to breast cancer and a binary target variable indicating malignancy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset's shape, information, and check for missing values.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Train an SVM model on the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R2 Score.

## Visualization

Visualize the decision boundary of the SVM model, showcasing its ability to distinguish between malignant and benign cases.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the code, install dependencies, and run the breast cancer prediction model.

```bash
# Example installation command
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example usage
python breast_cancer_prediction.py
